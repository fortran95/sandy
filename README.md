About Sandy
--------------
It wasn't until having *git init* run that I realized this name was
duplicated with the hurricane brought so much trouble to United States.
  Sands are everywhere, and they come together to get things change. That's
like microblogging. And centralized microblogging, like those big players,
have so obvious defeats that any organization wanted to prevent a number of
user accessing to their services is not a hardship. Further more, user's
privacy data are always stored on the server, making it insecure to use the
service.
